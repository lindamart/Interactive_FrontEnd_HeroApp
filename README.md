# Hero Generator

# Description

In this group project we created an application where a user can search for an image and use it to create a sample of a Hero image with text.  
They will also be presented with HTML and CSS code for the Hero image that they can then use in their own code. 

# APIs

We will use the Flickr API as well as a quote of the day API (Zen Quotes or Quotes REST)

# Wireframe or Design for the website

# Acceptance Criteria


As a user I want to be able to search for an image and have the ability to add text to a preview so that I can be presented with code that I can then copy and use in my HTML and CSS 

When the user opens the app a quote of the day appears in the header section.

When the user clicks the get new quote button a new quote appears.

When the user gives a keyword in the image search bar and presses submit they are presented with a group of images from flickr that matches their keyword.

When the user selects one of the images then their selection is shown in the preview model 

When the image is presented the user has the option to add text to the preview

The HTML & CSS code for the final image and text preview selected for the preview will show in the CSS and/or HTML code box

When the user clicks the clear button, all previously populated user info is reset

# What does the functioning prototype have in features for the first week?

By Saturday 10/9 our goals are as follows:

* Hit the Flickr API endpoint and fetch an array of photos that match a query string (whether that be directly from the user input or from a test query string)
* Connect the preview section with the live HTML and CSS code output sections
* Establish a layout structure and begin styling
