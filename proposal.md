## List of Tasks or Acceptance Criteria

When the user gives a keyword in the search bar and presses submit they are presented with a group of images from flickr that matches their keyword.

When the user selects one of the images then their selection is shown in the preview model.

The user has the ability to enter text to customize the content on their hero preview.

When the user clicks on the generate code button, the code for the HTML and CSS populates.

When the user clicks the clear button, all previously populated user info is reset
